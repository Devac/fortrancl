= Modules =

All the FortranCL interface is contained in the <tt>cl</tt> Fortran 90 module.

= Datatypes =

The following are Fortran datatypes that directly map to OpenCL C types.

  * cl_command_queue
  * cl_context
  * cl_device_id
  * cl_event
  * cl_kernel
  * cl_mem
  * cl_platform_id
  * cl_program
  * cl_sampler

The OpenCL [http://www.khronos.org/registry/cl/sdk/1.1/docs/man/xhtml/enums.html enumerated types] are mapped to Fortran integers.

= CL interface procedures =

These are the functions or subroutines from FortranCL that correspond to OpenCL functions.

All procedures return as last argument an <tt>integer</tt>. If this value is CL_SUCCESS, the call was successful, otherwise the value indicate the error.

  * [clEnqueueReadBuffer]
  * [clEnqueueWriteBuffer]
  * [clGetPlatformInfo]
  * [clGetDeviceInfo]
  * [clKernelSetArg]
  * [clKernelSetArgLocal]

= Additional functions =
  * [cl_bool]: Returns a CL boolean value, CL_TRUE or CL_FALSE, from a Fortran logical.

= Datatypes =

The following are Fortran datatypes that directly map to CL C types.

  * cl_command_queue
  * cl_context
  * cl_device_id
  * cl_event
  * cl_kernel
  * cl_mem
  * cl_platform_id
  * cl_program
  * cl_sampler

The following C CL types are mapped to Fortran integers:

  * cl_device_type
  * cl_bool

= CL interface procedures =

These are the functions or subroutines from FortranCL that correspond to C CL functions.

All procedures return as last argument an <tt>integer</tt>. If this value is CL_SUCCESS, the call was successful, otherwise the value indicate the error.

  * [clEnqueueReadBuffer]
  * [clEnqueueWriteBuffer]
  * [clGetDeviceInfo]

= Additional functions =
  * [cl_bool]: Returns a CL boolean value, CL_TRUE or CL_FALSE, from a Fortran logical.
